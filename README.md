### Descrption and how to play
In short, this is a rhythm game where you move between lanes to dodge notes.<br>
Use the left and right arrow keys to switch between lanes, or use the "a" and "d" keys.<br>
If you're at the fourth lane, going right brings you to the first lane.<br>
If you're at the first lane, going left brings you to the fourth lane.<br>

There are two songs, Final Hope and Cleyera, both by Riya. <br>
Final Hope is easier but contains gimmicks, while Cleyera has no gimmicks but harder charting.

The video is a bit over 5 minutes, but I literally can't cut it down more because the songs take 4 minutes and 20 seconds total
